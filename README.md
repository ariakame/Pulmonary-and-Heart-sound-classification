    Real-time heart and lung sound acquisition using MAX9814 and Arduino UNO

    Preprocessing pipeline with noise reduction, segmentation, and feature extraction (MFCCs, Spectrograms)

    CNN for heart sound classification (94.1% accuracy)

    GRU for lung sound classification (91.7% accuracy)

    Flask-based web interface for audio upload and diagnosis display

Tech Stack

    Python, Flask, TensorFlow/Keras

    Librosa, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib

    Arduino IDE for hardware interfacing
